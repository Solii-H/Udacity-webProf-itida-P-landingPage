## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Method

### Global variables

First I defined the global variables by getting the element that will be used for loops, functions and events.

### Loop

Loop created throw sections to get the Id and data-nav attribute, and create a list item related to each section.

### Toggling active class

A function named _*toggleActiveState*_ created to observe if the section is viewed in and intersecting with the spacific area within the window - from top -40% and the bottom -45% - and toggle active class for the section and its related link

### Event listener

An event listener created to listen to clicks in the nav menu and scroll smoothly to the target on click

### Making the site responsive

Changing the stylesheet by adding and modifying classses to make a burger menu using the **[W3School website]**(https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp)
